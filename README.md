# Jitsi Alphabetic Rearranger Chrome Plugin

This is a Chrome plugin that will allow you to re-arrange your Jitsi Meet
participants to follow an alphabetic order, from left-to-right and top-to-
bottom, based on their display names. Your video will be locked into the
bottom-most right position.


## Why?

Consider this use-case. You play Dungeons and Dragons with your friends
through some video conferencing service (e.g. Discord, Zoom, Jitsi Meet) and
also livestream your sessions using OBS Studio through some livestreaming
service (e.g. Twitch).
